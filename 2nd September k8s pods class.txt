2nd September k8s pods class
****************************

Types of pods
************
1. single pod
2. multiple pod
**3. static pod --> we will use the specific path ----> cd etc/kubernetes/manifests/     ---> ls (it shows etcd.yaml(it is the configuration files)kube-controller-manager.yaml, kube-apiserver.yaml,kube-scheduler.yaml )
**4. mirror pod


static pod
**********
cd  etc/kubernetes/manifests/

vi static-pod.yaml
******************
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod 
metadata:
  name: dummy-pod
spec:
 containers: 
   - name: main-container 
     image: nginx

kubectl apply -f .

kubectl get po --> shows the pod is running
kubectl delete pod dummy-pod
kubectl delete pod dummy-pod-controlplane  --> if we delete  it won't delete because it is a static pod 
if we delete the manifest file it will delete whole pod

rm -rf static-pod.yaml --> now it gets deleted

kubectl get po -->now it doesn't show the pods
