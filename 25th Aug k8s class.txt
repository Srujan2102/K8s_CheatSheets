How to install k8s?
*******************

where you install k8s is called a masternode/control plane

where you want to deploy is called a workernode

Entire masternode and workernode is called a k8s cluster

clusters are of 2 types
1. single node cluster--> having only single workernode
eg: k3c,minicube,kind,self hosted clusters

2. multi node cluster--> having more than 2 or above
a. self hosted clusters
   eg: kubeadm, kops, kube-spray
b. Cloud hosted clusters/services
   eg: AWS(EKS), AZURE(AKS)

If a company is not using any cloud that can be called as Onpremise
