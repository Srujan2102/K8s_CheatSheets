September 9th k8s k8s restart policy class
******************************************

k8s restart policy --> practical is not recommended
******************

pod level and container level is same only

k8s restart policy documentation

 pod-level container restart policy consists of 3 types 
 
1. Always -->   Automatically restarts the container after any termination except if the pod is success
2. OnFailure --> only restarts the container if it exists with any error (non-zero exit status)
3. Never --> Does not automatically restart the terminated container

eg: if the pod is failed it shows termination  --> for this if we write restart policy 

how to write manifest file for restart policy?
